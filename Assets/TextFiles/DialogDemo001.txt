Pachipachi|Pachi, pachi?
Lisette|Are you trying to tell me something?
Pachipachi|Pachi?
Lisette|What a strange squirrel.
Pachipachi|Sorry. You are not from here, are you?
Lisette|No, I have no idea where I am.
Pachipachi|I'm sorry, where are my manners?
Pachipachi|Pachipachi is my name. Nice to meet you.
Pachipachi|And this place here is called "Woods of Mystery".
Lisette|I'm Lisette.
Lisette|I've never met a talking squirrel.
Lisette|And "Woods of Mystery" doesn't tell me anything.
Pachipachi|Well then it's good that you have met me.
Pachipachi|I might know someone who can help you.
Lisette|Really?
Pachipachi|Old Father Oak knows a lot of things.
Pachipachi|We should visit him. He lives deep in the forest.
Lisette|Okay, let's go.
